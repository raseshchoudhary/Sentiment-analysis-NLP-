I have performed a sentiment analysis on this dataset.Since every message carries a sentiment behind it, I have taken all the rows of the text column and labelled to based upon the sentiment it carries. The sentiments can be genralized into three categories as follows.

1.Positive

2.Negative

3.Neutral

I have segregated the text into categories by calculating the average of the sentiment score, for example if the score was greater than 0 then its a positive sentence, if the score is less than 0 then its a negative sentence and if the score is neither then consider it to be a neutral statement.

After labelling the text into the aforementioned three categories, I have counted (with coding ofcourse) the number of positive, negative and neutral texts. By the way for sentiments specifically I has used python libraries called opinion_lexicon.

# The result

Most number of texts in the dataset has a positive emotion behind then followed by neutral and negative sentiments.
